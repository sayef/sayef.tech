# Revise Your CS Course

------

Gone through a long way; very close to the end of  my student life. Looking for a job. Itâ€™s high time I cleared up with  the mess I learned through the whole four years. I will share here the  things I can recall. Most of the resources are collected edited,  collaborated and re-written. Codes may not be bug free 100% but clear  enough for understanding the topics.
